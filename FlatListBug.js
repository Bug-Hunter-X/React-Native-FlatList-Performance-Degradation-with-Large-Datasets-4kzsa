This bug occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native with a large dataset.  The issue manifests as extremely slow scrolling or even crashes.  The root cause is often inefficient rendering of list items, particularly when the `renderItem` function is complex or not optimized.  This often results in dropped frames and a poor user experience.  The problem is exacerbated by not using key extractors.  Without them, React Native's diffing algorithm becomes significantly less efficient, leading to performance degradation.
